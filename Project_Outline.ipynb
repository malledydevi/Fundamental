Here's a mini project on a movie recommendation system using Python and the following libraries:

*Libraries:*

1. Pandas for data manipulation
2. NumPy for numerical computations
3. Scikit-learn for machine learning
4. Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

*Dataset:*

We'll use the MovieLens dataset, which contains:

1. 100,000 ratings from 600 users on 9,000 movies
2. Movie genres, titles, and release years

*Project Structure:*

1. *Data Preprocessing*

```
import pandas as pd

# Load ratings and movies datasets
ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Merge datasets on movie ID
data = pd.merge(ratings, movies, on='movieId')
```

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis*

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize rating distribution
sns.histplot(data['rating'])
plt.show()

# Top 10 most rated movies
top_movies = data['movieId'].value_counts().head(10)
print(top_movies)
```

3. *Recommendation Algorithm*

We'll implement a simple collaborative filtering algorithm using Matrix Factorization.

```
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create user-item matrix
user_item_matrix = pd.pivot_table(data, values='rating', index='userId', columns='movieId')

# Apply Matrix Factorization
nmf = NMF(n_components=10)
user_features = nmf.fit_transform(user_item_matrix)
movie_features = nmf.components_.T
```

4. *Recommendation Generation*

```
def recommend_movies(user_id, num_recommendations):
    # Get user features
    user_feature = user_features[user_id]
    
    # Calculate similarities with all movies
    similarities = cosine_similarity(user_feature.reshape(1, -1), movie_features)
    
    # Get top N recommended movies
    recommended_movies = movies.iloc[similarities.argsort()[-num_recommendations:]]
    
    return recommended_movies

# Test recommendation
recommended_movies = recommend_movies(1, 5)
print(recommended_movies)
```

5. *Evaluation*

```
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

# Evaluate recommendation accuracy
precision = precision_score(data['rating'], recommended_movies['rating'])
recall = recall_score(data['rating'], recommended_movies['rating'])

print(f'Precision: {precision:.3f}, Recall: {recall:.3f}')
```

*Example Use Cases:*

1. User-based recommendations: Recommend movies to users based on their past ratings.
2. Movie-based recommendations: Recommend similar movies to users who liked a particular movie.
3. Hybrid recommendations: Combine user-based and movie-based recommendations.

*Future Enhancements:*

1. Incorporate additional data (e.g., genres, directors, actors)
2. Implement more advanced algorithms (e.g., Deep Learning, Graph-based methods)
3. Develop a web application for interactive recommendations

This mini project demonstrates a basic movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Feel free to modify and expand upon this code!
