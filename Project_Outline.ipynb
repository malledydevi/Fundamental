*Project Title:* "StyleSentiment"

*Objective:*

Develop a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model to predict the sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral) of women's clothing reviews based on text analysis.

*Dataset:*

- Collect 5,000+ reviews from online fashion retailers (e.g., Amazon, Zappos, ASOS)
- Filter reviews for women's clothing only
- Preprocess data:
    1. Tokenization
    2. Stopword removal
    3. Stemming/Lemmatization
    4. Remove special characters and punctuation
    5. Label encoding (Positive: 1, Negative: 0, Neutral: 2)

*Features:*

1. Text data (review content)
2. Rating (1-5 stars)

*Target Variable:*

Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral)

*Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) Model:*

1. Import necessary libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
2. Split data into training (80%) and testing sets (20%)
3. Create MNB model: `MultinomialNB()`
4. Train model on training data
5. Evaluate model on testing data

*Evaluation Metrics:*

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-score
5. ROC-AUC

*Code:*
```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('reviews.csv')

# Preprocess data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['review'])
y = df['sentiment']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train MNB model
mnb = MultinomialNB()
mnb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = mnb.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

*Expected Results:*

- Accuracy: 85-90%
- Precision: 80-85%
- Recall: 85-90%
- F1-score: 85-90%
- ROC-AUC: 0.9-0.95

*Timeline:*

- Data collection and preprocessing: 2 days
- Model development and evaluation: 3 days
- Testing and refinement: 1 day

Total estimated time: 6 days
